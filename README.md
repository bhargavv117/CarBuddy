INTRODUCTION 
 
"CarBuddy" 
 
 Welcome to CarBuddy, an innovative mobile application and 
digital platform designed to revolutionize car maintenance by 
connecting customers with mechanics and service providers for 
door-to-door car servicing. 
 
 The platform includes a Real-Time Mechanic Tracking system 
that provides users with transparency and helps reduce waiting 
anxiety. This feature allows users to book car service from their 
home, choose service types, and track the assigned mechanic's 
exact location live on a map. 
 
 This platform allows users to book their car service by selecting 
a preferred date and time slot. It also offers a marketplace where 
users can choose from various car services like oil changes, tire 
replacements, or AC repairs. 
 
 Our main goal is to help car owners save time, avoid the need 
to visit garages, and provide a smooth, transparent, and 
user-friendly car maintenance experience.
